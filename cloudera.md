I chose the data product Cloudera, and its website is https://www.cloudera.com/. It is a hybrid open source relational database database that works as both an in-memory database and on-disk database. It is hosted on the Cloud. Cloudera offers a free course on how to use Python on its site. Python is accessible on Cloudera by establishing a CDP Operational Database (COD) through Phoenix.
