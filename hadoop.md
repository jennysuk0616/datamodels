For a data model we havenâ€™t discussed yet, I chose the data product Hadoop, and its website is https://hadoop.apache.org/. It is an open source tool. According to my research, Hadoop is an alternative software program to the traditional database model that allows the inputting of large unstructured data as well as structured data, whereas most databases accept semi-structured or structured data.
