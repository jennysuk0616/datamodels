I chose the data product Robomongo, and its website is https://robomongo.org/. It is an open source No-SQL database. It offers a graph data model program. It can pair with Mac, Unix, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Python can access the site by installing a Python Drive, importing MongoClient from pymongo, and establishing a connection to Mongo Daemon Service.
