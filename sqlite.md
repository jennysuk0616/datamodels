I chose the data product SQLite, and its website is https://sqlite.org/index.html. It is an open source tool. Its database type is an embedded hosting model. It is stored in the Cloud. Java and Python can access the site through mobile phones and computers, and can pair with Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. SQLite (the most recent version) can be accessed on Python through the sqlite3 model, which is pioneered by Gerhard Haring.
