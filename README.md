# Homework 0: DataModel Ontology

I chose the data product Neo4j, and its website is https://neo4j.com/. It is an open source tool. Its database type is a graph database. It is hosted on the Cloud. It is coded in Java, and can pair with Windows and Linux/Unix operating systems. One can simply install the Neo4j desktop on Python or Java to access it.  

I chose the data product SQLite, and its website is https://sqlite.org/index.html. It is an open source tool. Its database type is an embedded hosting model. It is stored in the Cloud. Java and Python can access the site through mobile phones and computers, and can pair with Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. SQLite (the most recent version) can be accessed on Python through the sqlite3 model, which is pioneered by Gerhard Haring. 

I chose the data product Redis, and its website is https://redis.io/. It is an open source tool. Its database type is No-SQL or non-relational. It is stored in the Cloud. Java or Python can access it through Windows and Linux operating systems. To connect it to Java or Python, we can use the Redis cluster to download the necessary software package. 

I chose the data product Couchbase, and its website is https://www.couchbase.com/. It is an open source tool. Its database type is No-SQL. It is hosted on the Cloud. It can pair with Windows and Linux operating systems. One can access Couchbase to Java or Python by connecting it to a bucket. 

I chose the data product MariaDB, and its website is https://mariadb.org/. It is an open source tool. It is a relational database. It is hosted on the Cloud. It can pair with Mac, Unix, Linux, and Windows operating systems. One can connect MariaDB to Python by using the MySQL Python Package or the MariaDB Connector/Python. MariaDB also provides Python support. 

I chose the data product Altibase, and its website is https://altibase.com/en/index.php. It is a hybrid open source relational database database that works as both an in-memory database and on-disk database. It utilizes a client/server hosting model. There are two ways to access Altibase through Python, which are the ODBC and JDBC methods.

I chose the data product Cloudera, and its website is https://www.cloudera.com/.
It is a hybrid open source relational database database that works as both an in-memory database and on-disk database. It is hosted on the Cloud. Cloudera offers a free course on how to use Python on its site. Python is accessible on Cloudera by establishing a CDP Operational Database (COD) through Phoenix. 

I chose the data product Robomongo, and its website is https://robomongo.org/. It is an open source No-SQL database. It offers a graph data model program. It can pair with Mac, Unix, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Python can access the site by installing a Python Drive, importing MongoClient from pymongo, and establishing a connection to Mongo Daemon Service. 

For a data model we haven’t discussed yet, I chose the data product Hadoop, and its website is https://hadoop.apache.org/. It is an open source tool. According to my research, Hadoop is an alternative software program to the traditional database model that allows the inputting of large unstructured data as well as structured data, whereas most databases accept semi-structured or structured data. 

Most of my research was done with the help of Software Testing Help’s Top 30 Most Popular Database Management Software: Complete List website. The link is https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/database-management-software/.
